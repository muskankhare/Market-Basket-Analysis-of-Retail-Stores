# Market-Basket-Analysis-of-Retail-Stores
Market basket analysis is a technique used to identify the relationship between the products that
are frequently purchased together. The problem involves identifying the frequent itemsets and
association rules from a large dataset of transactions. The target is to identify the frequent
patterns within a reasonable time frame.
The main goal of this problem statement is to analyse the market basket, from large volumes of
transactional data efficiently in lesser time than traditional database handling tools and libraries,
and provide insights into the relationships between the products.
